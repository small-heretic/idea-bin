    <h1>About the Creator</h1>

    <p><strong>Claire Benham</strong> is an Anglo-American nerd, and both an aspiring wordsmith and polymath. Ey grew up in Connecticut, in a suburban town near the city of New Haven. Most of eir childhood was centered around work in the local public library, both volunteer and paid; around reading as many books as possible; and around the beginnings of some of the tale ideas which have survived to this day. [Name] attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania from 2013 to 2017, earning a BA in Linguistics. As of 2017, ey resides in Boston, Massachusetts, where ey attends Simmons University pursuant of a Master's degree in Information Science.</p>

    <p>[Name] pursues and cultivates a number of interests, the majority relating to words, oratory, or storytelling in some way. Prose fiction is of course one of the primary, with multiple novel or short story ideas being hosted in eir mind at any given time, and artwork being composed or created in association with these tales. [Name] also spends a significant portion of time conlanging, both for pleasure and as a way to maintain eir linguistics writing and research skills. If ey had more time, ey would like to play tabletop rpgs with a group - however, as it is, often ey merely sets aside time to play solo in order to have an excuse to roll polyhedral dice. Ey also enjoys cleaning and reorganizing eir apartment.</p>
